<h2 id="alone-i-went">Alone I Went</h2>

<p>Standing together petrified, my Mother, my brother Buck and I were glued to the spot staring in
horror at the bright yellow rim of the black tornado cloud rapidly approaching our city. We could
see the horrendous destruction blended in with the sickening yellow underneath but covering the
entire area near the horizon. Later, they told us it was actually twin tornadoes that struck
everything in the path of destruction.</p>

<p>Much of our entire downtown area was leveled, and Gainesville was referred to
as &ldquo;A City Laid Waste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To our dying day, each of us who experienced the devastation of the terrible
storms will remember the sound of the mighty thunder that sounded like many freight trains settling
down in a freight yard.</p>

<p>Our family was extremely fortunate to have us all alive even though most of
us were in different locations in town. We tried desperately to get on with our lives. However, at
least once weekly tremendous thunderstorms occurred in the evenings, bringing back anew fears of
another tornado. I, particularly, was perified each time I heard thunder lurking in the dark clouds,
even though I knew they were not the same.</p>

<p>By the time school was out, Mother and Daddy made
arrangements for me to spend a couple of weeks at Grandma and Grandpa Reynolds&rsquo; farm to give a
change of scenery. They all felt it would be like a tonic to me. I had never visited the farm alone
before, and I was a little uneasy. However, my Mother knew Grandma would keep me so busy with chores
and teaching me things a young girl should know that I&rsquo;d have little time to fret over my recent
memories, horrible as they were.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, I packed the large suitcase I had borrowed from my
older brother, Curtis. He had earned the money to buy that bag on his paper route. He kept the
suitcase in a bag with a zipper to protect it. Since Curt and I were pretty good buddies, he knew
that I would take care of his prized possession.</p>

<p>As I packed, I wondered why I was the only one
going. Mickey and/or Buck usually went with me. &ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;maybe now that I&rsquo;m
older, Grandma and I will learn to like each other better. Without her favorite Grandchild, Mickey,
along, she just might pay a little attention to me! It might not be so bad after all, being there by
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After coming to the above conclusion, I started paying more attention to choosing the
clothes from my meager wardrobe. This Great Depression had made almost all of America
without enough funds to live on. My Mother was a great seamstress, and somehow she managed to keep
us in clothes that were presentable. Since I was the youngest ofthree daughters, hand-me-downs were
plentiful in my closet, but thank goodness, my two older sisters took pretty good care of their
clothes. On a rare occasion, my Mother would surprise me with a new dress.</p>

<p>My Daddy drove me to the
farm, and on the way I suddenly had misgivings and wished I were not going.</p>

<p>But soon I saw
Grandpa waiting for me as soon as Daddy turned into his yard. I jumped out of the car as soon as it
stopped and ran toward him. Grandpa swooped me up in his arms in a great hug, and whispered in my
ear, &ldquo;I have the Checkers all set up. Care to try to beat me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt myself smiling from ear to ear
because Grandpa knew how much I loved to play Checkers - especially with him. Sometimes I even won.</p>

<p>I turned around and looked almost sadly at my Daddy. The hug I gave him assured him that he was
still number one with me. I promised to have a good time, and he promised to pick me up in two weeks
- after church, of course. I watched a little apprehensively as Daddy drove away.</p>

<p>When I would have
  carefully picked up my belongings in Curtis&rsquo; suitcase, I discovered Grandmother who was waiting at
the door.  I looked up at my Grandmother as I went through the door. I couldn&rsquo;t help wondering why
she was not out in the yard to meet me also. Before I gave that much thought, she said, &ldquo;Your Grandpa
was so anxious to see you, I thought I&rsquo;d just wait at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I softened a little and returned
her smile.  Not long after our short visiting period - which lasted only a few minutes since our
whole family had spent an overnight with our Grandparents at Christmas time - Grandpa led me into
the parlor. He indeed had our Checker game ready to start, as he had promised. I cheerfully sat down
to see if my skills had improved since last summer. Grandma excused herself saying something about
bringing us some lemonade.</p>

<p>Grandpa, as expected, won the first game. I smiled good-naturedly, but I
had picked up on two methods he used for winning that I had never noticed before. On the second
game, I executed those newfound moves and I defeated him soundly!</p>

<p>Grandpa threw back his head and
laughed heartily. &ldquo;Young Lady, it didn&rsquo;t take you long to figure out the new moves I recently
adopted. My friend, Josh, who is from Indiana, showed me those when we were playing last week. He is
now working for me in Commerce,&rdquo; Grandpa said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandpa, you work so hard I&rsquo;m glad you take time out now and then for a Checker game,&rdquo; I said 
sincerely.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All work and no play, I always say,&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandpa answered a little flippantly, but I could see he was moved with my concern.</p>

<p>Grandma came in
about that time with the large pitcher of lemonade, glasses and fresh-baked sugar cookies.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;She must not be as &lsquo;Anti-Katie&rdquo; as I thought. Those are my favorite cookies,&rdquo; I reasoned happily
as I took the first delicious bite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am just going to sit here and watch for awhile,&rdquo;
Grandma said companionably. If the truth were known, Grandma could beat any of her forty
grandchildren at will; and, many times, she even beat Grandpa.</p>

<p>Was it my imagination or was Grandma
actually rooting for me at many crucial moments in our games? I began to take some notice of this.
Yes, I think she did root for me on that last play. She smiled at me then at Grandpa. &ldquo;Bud, this
girl has sharpened her game since last time. You are going to have to really concentrate to beat
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandpa raised an eyebrow, tinged with white, and said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right, Mattie. Just last
summer, I even had to let her win occasionally. Now I will be lucky if she will let me win.&rdquo; Grandpa
smiled his crooked smile he used when he was pleased.</p>

<p>I sifted through their words, separating the
nonsense from the truth, and decided if I could beat Grandpa, I surely could beat Mary and Cary when
I saw the later in the week.</p>

<p>Ever so often, I felt Grandma&rsquo;s eyes on me. When I&rsquo;d look up, her
expression was not critical as I&rsquo;d expected, but she seemed to have a kind, even approving attitude
toward me. Still a little skeptical, I continued to plat Checkers in earnest. I really had to think
about my moves to ever beat Grandpa.</p>

<p>Grandpa suddenly leaned back in his chair and declared,
&ldquo;Mattie, this girl is getting to be an expert! Why don&rsquo;t you play her a game or two and let me have
a chance to catch my breath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandma, taken completely by surprise, slowly rose from her chair and
sat down in the chair Grandpa was holding for her.  &ldquo;Now Bud, you know I don&rsquo;t play this game very
often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way you play this game, you don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> any practice!&rdquo; Grandpa grinned knowingly.</p>

<p>I have a strong feeling Grandma let me win the first game for several reasons, the least of which
was that she knew on the second she would beat me soundly - which she did!</p>

<p>I gathered up my bruised
pride and concentrated with all my might to beat Grandma on the third game - which I did. She didn&rsquo;t
just let me win either, she had not learned to defend against those two new moves Grandpa had taught
me today.</p>

<p>All three of us had a good laugh out of the furrowed brows necessary to defeat anyone
today.</p>

<p>Grandma excused herself again saying that it was time for her to start supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I help?&rdquo; I asked quickly, kind of hoping she would say no.  &ldquo;Not this time. You just got here. You continue
with your Checker games, and you can wash the dishes, if you will. Ethel says that you are getting
real good at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; was all I could manage. It was true - I was getting good at doing
dishes, but that really did not mean that I enjoyed doing them!</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="then-there-were-three">Then There Were Three</h1>

<p>The only real fun I derived from washing dishes was preparing the suds
before starting. After I had worked up what I considered to be enough
suds, I picked up the three oatmeal bowls Grandma had served us soup in
for dinner. She had carefully explained to me that they, along with
three others, had just arrived from the mail-order house. Tonight was
the first time she had used them. Special care must be given in washing
the bowls.</p>

<p>Perhaps the lecture Grandma had given me to use caution when washing her
bowls had something to do with it, as she had made me nervous. I rather
think that, along with my unusally slippery, sudsy hands, did the trick.
Anpvay, as I picked up the bowls they never saw the dishpan - they fell
with a loud sickening crash at my feet!</p>

<p>In the door appeared an instant Grandma - horror and anger all over her
face!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Lady, that&rsquo;s the last time you&rsquo;ll wash my dishes! Now grab the
broom and dustpan from the pantry and clean this mess up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My eyes had filled with tears of embarrassment and shock. I just was not
used to Grandma&rsquo;s homemade soap. It took so much soap to work up a
lather that I had used entirely too much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandma, I am so sorry! Your oatmeal bowls - they just slipped out of
my hands,&rdquo; I wailed. I could tell from Grandma&rsquo;s face that she was
convinced I dropped the bowls on purpose to keep from washing dishes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The deed is done, so get it all cleaned up and go in with Grandpa. He
will be playing the organ. When I finish up in here, we&rsquo;ll all sing.&rdquo;
She softened a little.</p>

<p>Grandma muttered something I couldn&rsquo;t make out,
but I did not stick around long enough to find out what it was. I
couldn&rsquo;t believe my good fortune - I really had not broken the bowls on
purpose; but now I didn&rsquo;t have to wash dishes this
whole visit!</p>

<p>Grandpa asked, &ldquo;What happened, Sugar Babe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sobbed, &ldquo;My hands were too slippery and the new bowls were heavy. They
just fell before I could even get them to the dishpan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you did not drop them on purpose; and your Grandma will soon
realize that, too. She is a very fair person. It&rsquo;s just that it took
three whole weeks for the bowls to arrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said, hopefully, &ldquo;I have some money saved up. Maybe Grandma will let
me buy her some new bowls to make up for my breaking those.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be necessary. Just try to be extra careful next time - and
there will be a next time after she gets over your breaking her special
bowls. Think on
the bright side - we did get to use them once tonight!&rdquo; Grandpa smiled
kindly around his large white moustache.</p>

<p>Grandpa started playing the organ softly. He looked at me and said,
&ldquo;Sugar Babe, would you like to pump the organ for me? I&rsquo;ve had a hard
day and it would help me a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe my ears! I had never been allowed to pump the organ
before and I eagerly put a lot of energy into this joyous task. Mickey
or Irene occasionally pumped the organ for Grandma, but here I was
pumping for Grandpa. The broken oatmeal bowls flew completely out of my
mind!</p>

<p>Grandma came in quietly and put a hand on my shoulder. &ldquo;Katie, you may
select the first song for us to sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was so relieved to be in Grandma&rsquo;s good graces that I chose what I
knew to be her very favorite hymn. We sang with gusto. That first
evening of my visit, we sang my favorites, Grandma&rsquo;s hymns and even some
of Grandpa&rsquo;s Western favorites. It seemed the singing helped all of us
erase the memory of the unfortunate bowls!</p>

<p>Finally, I leaned my head upon Grandpa&rsquo;s arm. I was so sleepy that I
dozed off happily.</p>

<p>Grandpa said softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry her upstairs. Is her pallet ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandma nodded.</p>

<p>After Grandpa carried me effortlessly upstairs, they both tucked my
sleeping
form into the comfortable pallet. (A pallet was the forerunner of a
modern sleeping bag.)</p>

<p>Grandma paused, looked back at me and said, &ldquo;She looks so small as she
lies there asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That fiery disposition of hers is completely calmed down and she
appears so peaceful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a fiery disposition, Grandpa,&rdquo; I said, rousing enough to
hear what they were saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you look at her! I thought she was sound asleep,&rdquo; Grandma said.
&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; I murmured into my pillow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon I&rsquo;ll teach her how to churn,&rdquo; Grandma said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to teach her too much too soon, Mattie. She is only a little
girl,&rdquo; Grandpa warned.</p>

<p>The smile on Grandma&rsquo;s face was hard to interpret, but I left Grandpa to
think about it alone, because I had drifted off to sleep where there was
no worry about broken oatmeal bowls.</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="almost-like-grandpas">Almost Like Grandpa&rsquo;s</h1>

<p>As I walked down the stairs to the kitchen for breakfast, I overheard Grandpa tell Grandma that he
was taking me with him to Maysville today to see the most recent house he&rsquo;d built. He said they were
finishing the wiring, etc. this week. I heard Grandma agree with him that it would be a good idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Morning,&rdquo; I said cheerfully. They both looked up and smiled graciously at me.  &ldquo;Did I hear
correctly that Grandpa is taking me to see his latest house today? That&rsquo;s great! I have always
wanted to see one.&rdquo; I was all excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are indeed going with me. Grandma has some sewing to catch up on, so you and I will have a
great day together. There is a new small café that recently opened in Maysville, so we will try that
one for lunch. I have had a bunch of sandwiches for lunch lately, so it will be a nice change. In my
line of work, you are not always near a restaurant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be nice not to prepare a lunch for your large appetite for a change.&rdquo; Grandma winked at her
six-foot-three husband.  &lsquo;As soon as you finish your breakfast, Katie, we will be off to the sleepy
town of Maysville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir!&rdquo; I cried and started eating my breakfast as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slow down, Katie.&rdquo; Grandma said smilingly. &ldquo;Maysville won&rsquo;t run off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we were riding rapidly along in Grandpa&rsquo;s Model T Touring car, I couldn&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d eagerly
accepted Grandpa&rsquo;s offer to ride into Maysville today. His driving made me very nervous, but his
offer to show me the house he was finishing up was too tempting to turn down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sugar Babe, I want to tell you that the house we are going to see is being built for our new
minister. You know we belong to Wilson&rsquo;s Church. This house is less than two blocks from the church.
We all felt it would be the perfect distance from the church both for the Minister&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s
privacy and the fact that he could just walk to the church without having to cross that old railroad
track, as he would have if we had built on the other lot under consideration.</p>

<p>I was acutely aware that Grandpa never said anything in a few words, but it didn&rsquo;t matter this
morning. Nothing could dampen the fact that I was spending my first full day at the farm with my
beloved Grandpa.</p>

<p>I tuned back in to what Grandpa was saying. &ldquo;The church voted to use the plans I used to build our
own house. They liked the looks of mine, and in these hard times, it saved a little money not to
have to order new blue prints. I made the Parsonage a little bigger than ours and made a few
changes; but it is basically the same. &ldquo;Grandpa said softly remembering he had built his own house
for his Bride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love your house, Grandpa.&rdquo; Grandpa grinned</p>

<p>down at me with real affection. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a great Kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandpa, when Grandma found out where we going today, she told me I would probably see Guy and she
said he is the electrician wiring your Minister&rsquo;s house. Isn&rsquo;t he the twins and Woody&rsquo;s brother?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is indeed. You haven&rsquo;t seen him in several years, have you? In fact, you haven&rsquo;t been here long
enough to see Mary and Cary yet, but you will see them soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was thoughtful. &ldquo;No, Grandpa, it has been about three years since I saw Guy. Of course I saw Mary
and Cary last summer. I heard that Guy was off learning to be an electrician.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an observant little girl. That is exactly where he was. But now he has been working for me
about a year,&rdquo; Grandpa stated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Guy a good electrician?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the best. He has been a great help to me and I have come to depend on him. I can&rsquo;t be
everywhere at once, and I know if Guy is on the job, I can relax a little,&rdquo; Grandpa finished
sincerely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night, when you were playing the organ and we were singing, I couldn&rsquo;t help wondering why you
don&rsquo;t put electricity in your own home. Now that you trust Guy so much, couldn&rsquo;t he install the
wiring for you, Grandpa?&rdquo; I asked sincerely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, hold on, Sugar Babe! I really need Guy right now on the houses we are building.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandpa saw the earnest look on my face. &ldquo;I know reading by lamp light leaves a lot to be desired.
One of these days, I&rsquo;ll make a special effort to modernize our house with electricity and indoor
plumbing. Right now I stay so busy building other people&rsquo;s houses, I really have not found it too
pressing for such facilities just yet. When you live in the country you expect a few
inconveniences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought to myself, &ldquo;Yeah, like the three holer outhouse!&rdquo; Aloud, I said, &ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Grandpa drove over the steep railroad track and into the yard of the new parsonage. I looked
over at Wilson&rsquo;s Church down the way and thought how convenient it would be for the Pastor and his
family to live so close to the church.</p>

<p>Grandpa could stop his car almost as fast as he could drive, so we were beside the house in no time.</p>

<p>I opened the door and ran quickly to the corner of the porch.</p>

<p>Grandpa, surprised, said, &ldquo;What is it, Sugar Babe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t answer until I found the metal plaque which read:</p>

<p>Built by: Jasper M. Reynolds  June 7, 1936</p>

<p>I said beaming, &ldquo;Mary told me last summer that you put a plaque on every house you build, and I
wanted to see for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandpa exhibited a full Grandpa smile and said rather proudly, &ldquo;Just a quirk of mine to let
everyone know I did my best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judging from your house and this one, you should be very proud&rdquo; I said with my admiration.</p>

<p>As we reached the top of the new stairs, the front door opened and Guy came toward us with his hands
outstretched. He gave me a big hug and winked at Grandpa.  &ldquo;Katie, you&rsquo;ve really grown since I last
saw you.&rdquo; Guy stood back to look at me. &ldquo;Pretty little thing, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grow about an inch or so a year. And thank you for the compliment. You look great and the same
except&hellip;&rdquo; I trailed off.</p>

<p>Guy laughed heartily. &ldquo;Yeah, I know - except that I have less hair. Most of the Reynolds clan have
premature white hair by my age and a full head of hair at that. I must have inherited genes from my
mother&rsquo;s side. At least, mine is not completely white - what I have left, that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandpa grinned, then got serious. &ldquo;Guy, are you just about ready to finish up this job? Remember,
our Pastor&rsquo;s family is expecting to move in next Thursday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir. I should be completely done by Wednesday noon,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great. I saw Pastor Martin in the hardware store earlier this week, and he said his wife is
getting anxious to move in.&rdquo; Grandpa had a twinkle in his eyes as he recalled how anxious his own
wife, Mattie, had been to move into their own house years ago. This one did not have the unique hand
molded bathtub he had lovingly fashioned for his bride, but he had instructed the plumber to install
indoor plumbing, so that was a plus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sugar Babe, come along and I&rsquo;ll show you the whole house. You will be able to detect the minor
changes we made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After we said goodbye to Guy, we climbed back into Grandpa&rsquo;s shiny car. Before Grandpa cranked his
car, he turned to me and said, quite seriously, &ldquo;Last week, I had an opportunity to buy two prime
cemetery lots in Wilson&rsquo;s Church yard - right in the middle of ones many members of our &lsquo;Reynolds
Clan&rsquo; have bought. Would you like to see them while we are this close?&rdquo; Grandpa&rsquo;s face was solemn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Grandpa!&rdquo; I almost shouted. &ldquo;l don&rsquo;t even want to think of the time when you and Grandma are
not at your house, expecting visits from us all.&rdquo; I was horrified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Sugar Babe. I didn&rsquo;t mean to upset you.  It is just a fact of life and I was able to buy
the choice two lots. Forgive me for being so morbid.  Now - remember I have a lot of houses to
build, so I plan to be around a long time. Feel Better?&rdquo; Grandpa finished lamely. It was not often
word ailed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe a little. I know what, Grandpa.  Why don&rsquo;t we drive down to Hurricane Shoals instead. I love
to look at that water cascading over the rocks.&rdquo; I said suddenly wanting very much to see the
Shoals.</p>

<p>Grandpa was happy for a diversion and offwe went to spend a pleasant time enjoying the same Shoals
the Indians had been fascinated with so many years ago.</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="bathtub-luxury">Bathtub Luxury</h1>

<p>When I waked up, the great time Grandpa and I had enjoyed yesterday was still in my
thoughts - especially the fun at seeing Hurricane Shoals again. That special place
never fails to fascinate me. I decided that I would make a special effort to be nice
and helpful to Grandma. I really appreciated the effort she seemed to be making to be
good to me. She still won&rsquo;t let me wash the dishes, and I will enjoy that time while
I can, but I am sure that will change soon.</p>

<p>I walked into the large kitchen with the huge old stove, and found Grandpa and
Grandma finishing their first cup of coffee leisurely while waiting for me to come
downstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo; I said cheerily. &ldquo;Grandpa and I had such fun yesterday. Your Pastor&rsquo;s
house is so beautiful and it is so much like yours.&rdquo; I said showing what a good mood
I was in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning to you!&rdquo; Grandpa and Grandma said in unison. The smiles on their faces
was worth the extra effort. Grandpa and I filled Grandma in on the activities of
yesterday.</p>

<p>Grandma asked, &ldquo;Did you get to see Guy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes Ma&rsquo;am. He is such a nice man and a great electrician. I am rather proud to be
his cousin,&rdquo; I said nicely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad. Marie raised a fine family. All of them are kind and considerate, but each
has his or her own brand of a sense of humor. Their Father, Roy, had a marvelous
sense of humor and I guess he passed that on to his children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While you ladies discuss the rest of our forty grandchildren, I have to go to work!&rdquo;
Grandpa smiled as he finished the last gulp of his second cup of coffee. Grandma and
I watched as we followed with our eyes the trail of red Georgia dust that meant
Grandpa was already speeding toward Maysville.</p>

<p>Grandma turned to me and said, &ldquo;How about another cup of Kettle Tea?&rdquo; (That was a
Great Depression concoction consisting of hot water from the kettle, about one-third
cup of milk and two teaspoons of sugar. Most children and some adults enjoyed this
often.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be great. I was listening so hard&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t really get to enjoy my first
cup.&rdquo; I said politely. &ldquo;By the way, Grandma, while we are having our second cup&ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will be my third cup of coffee.&rdquo; Grandma interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, what I would like for us to talk about is your own special bathtub. Mickey and
some of the others have told me how it was made, but I would like to hear the story
from you,&rdquo; I said sweetly but sincerely.</p>

<p>Grandma&rsquo;s face lit up when she started talking about her special bathtub.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First of all, you have to take into consideration that your Grandpa built my bathtub when he
built this house for us soon after we were married. That smooth as silk finish he
accomplished then is still just as smooth today, after all these years. My tub was
then and is now a wonder to have in a country house with no other plumbing
facilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard correctly from everyone how Grandpa painstakingly and lovingly, I
suppose, molded my bathtub with his own hands. When he had it in the exact shape he
wanted it, he left a drainage hole (like modern bathtubs). Before he molded the
bathtub, Grandpa had connected a drainpipe to the outside near the horse trough. When
he connected that to the tub, it was obvious he thought of everything possible to
give me the privacy I craved. He really built me a beauty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was fascinated by Grandma&rsquo;s story - not so much because of what she was saying, but
that she could call forth so much emotion in her voice in the telling!</p>

<p>I said quietly,
&ldquo;Thank you, Grandma, for telling me the real story about your awesome tub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not willing to leave her magic mood so quickly that had caused Grandma&rsquo;s unexpected
emotion to surface, I said, &ldquo;One more thing I&rsquo;d like to know is how you get hot water
to fill your tub when you are ready to take a bath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandma still looked contented
as she proceeded to tell me about the massive old iron stove that had been in her
family well since they moved into this house. &ldquo;You see, these huge old stoves have a
large water reservoir on the side that keeps water hot after meals have been cooked.
It takes a lot of stove wood to get the stove hot enough to cook properly. The heavy
iron construction of the stove keeps the water hot for many hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandma continued with a smile at one corner of her mouth that us kids seldom saw. &ldquo;I
remember one morning when our children were young. After I had served breakfast, your
Grandpa had to leave early for work and the kids (our three girls and six boys)
frantically managed to catch the school bus, I sat down to enjoy a second cup
of coffee. I decided to take a long, leisurely bath in my own special tub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granted it was a little inconvenient for me to transport the hot water from the
reservoir in the stove, but I had done this so many times, I scarcely noticed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
use the new scented soap the Watkins salesman sold me last week, I decided. Usually,
I only buy vanilla extract and such items from him, but the soap smelled so nice, I
couldn&rsquo;t resist. Anything would be an improvement over the homemade Lye soap!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandma said with a wistful grin on her face, &ldquo;Sometimes I wish the Watkins man and
others would carry more of the items we need so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to hitch up
Nellie Belle so often to go into nearby Maysville.&rdquo; When she thought further about
this, she added, &ldquo;Since my trips into Maysville are the social highlights of some
weeks, I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t complain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in frail health for several years, and your mother, Ethel, had to start
helping with the cooking,&rdquo; Grandma said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. She has always reminded us how she started making biscuits when she was nine
years old. She insists she had to stand on a stool,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That she did. It wasn&rsquo;t long before she wanted to start cooking other things, too.
My other two girls were older than Ethel, so they almost took over the household
chores until my health improved,&rdquo; Grandma said softly, remembering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even Aunt Flora,&rdquo; I said before thinking. &ldquo;She seems to hate housework.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does now, but back then, she would make beds that would make an Army sergeant proud,&rsquo;
Grandma said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That left the cleaning and the ironing to Aunt Ruth, right?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the size of it,&rdquo; Grandma finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandma, when I looked very closely at your tub, in the back, I saw Grandpa&rsquo;s name
and a date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandma smiled broadly. &ldquo;Your Grandpa signed his name to works he was proud of. Many
of the large homes in and around Commerce have plaques on the corner stone saying,
&lsquo;Built by Jasper M. Reynolds&rsquo; and a date. He is probably the most respected builder
around these parts today.&rdquo; There was that crooked smile on Grandma&rsquo;s face again.</p>

<p>Pride welled up in my chest to think that my beloved Grandpa was so well-known and
respected for his building sturdy attractive houses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It takes a lot of stove wood to get the stove hot enough to cook on, as I said, but,
once it is ready, hot biscuits and/or corn bread bake in the oven while a meat or
two and several vegetables can be cooked on the top surface in old iron pots. The
warmer above keeps bread and potatoes wann for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words, you can put as many things on the top of the stove as there is room,
because it is hot all over the top surface, right?&rdquo; I asked with interest.</p>

<p>Grandma was about to agree with me when she suddenly looked out the window and nodded
her head. Before I could wonder what was going on, the side door burst open and the
twins, Mary and Cary rushed forward to greet me! I was so surprised, but excited as I
thought they were staying in Commerce at an aunt&rsquo;s house for two more days. &ldquo;We
talked our Aunt into bringing us home a couple of days early when Austin told us you
were here already,&rdquo; Mary said quickly.</p>

<p>Cary smiled broadly as he too seemed glad to see me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Ellen packed us a lunch with enough to include you, Katie,&rdquo; Mary said. She
turned to Grandma, &ldquo;Please let Katie go with us now to our house and I&rsquo;m sure Woody
can make some lemonade to go with these ham sandwiches. Pretty please, Grandma. We
haven&rsquo;t seen Katie since last summer and we have so much to catch up on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandma smiled and said, &ldquo;How could I say <em>no</em> to such a plea? Go ahead, Katie, but be
sure to be back before supper.&rdquo; To herself, Grandma said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to wait a little
longer to start instructing Katie on chores and how to learn to manage a household.
Bud was right - she is just a little young. I&rsquo;ll have to make her want to do them.
I&rsquo;ll start with churning. She&rsquo;ll enjoy that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandma graciously said, &ldquo;Good to have you back kids. Now run along - I think I&rsquo;ll
take my rest early today.&rdquo;</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="fun-with-cousins">Fun With Cousins</h1>

<p>The three of us cousins skipped happily along toward Aunt Marie&rsquo;s house. We were
talking like magpies trying to catch up since we saw each other last summer.
Suddenly, I became aware of Grandma&rsquo;s voice calling me. She motioned to Mary and Cary
to run along ahead and told them I&rsquo;d ioin them shortly.</p>

<p>The twins hurried on anxious to see their other and sister, Woody, as they had been
at their aunt&rsquo;s for a few days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you could be back here by 5 o&rsquo;clock sharp as I have to explain
to you how to do the churning for me tomorrow morning. I can do that before I get
busy with supper.&rdquo; Grandma said almost sweetly.</p>

<p>I got all excited. &ldquo;Grandma, do you mean you are reâlly going to let me churn? Mickey
always does that for you. you bet I&rsquo;ll be home by five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t quite understand the slight smile and satisfied look on Grandma&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now run along. Mary and Cary are probably home by now&rdquo; Grandma turned toward the
house, secretly anticipating her afternoon rest which usually lasted for two hours.</p>

<p>Just past Grandpa&rsquo;s workshop, I stooped down to pick a small bouquet of wild
flowers. I thought Aunt Marie might like them.</p>

<p>Happily I hurried along when suddenly I came to an abrupt halt! In a hole on the
side of the path lay a large snake coiled and ready to strike at me. I screamed at
the top of my lungs even though I was glued to the spot with fright.</p>

<p>I heard Austin&rsquo;s voice yell at me to stay calm and very still. He was on his
horse and coming toward me at a full gallop. When he was close enough, he aimed his
rifle at the snake. All it took him was a single shot! He then scooped me up without
dismounting and headed back toward his home.</p>

<p>April is Mary and Cary&rsquo;s brother and is the Overseer of Grandpa&rsquo;s large farm. He had
stopped by his house for a sandwich before continuing his duties. Lucky for me!</p>

<p>Austin said gently, &ldquo;That was not a poisonous snake - it just helps keep the rat
population down. Normally, I would not have killed it, but you were so frightened, I
wanted you to feel safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said softly, &ldquo;Thank you, Austin. I was terrified. All snakes scare me to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austin grinned and said, &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re here now. The kids are really looking forward
to your visit this afternoon. They have elaborate plans to enteriain you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sweep of his hand, he indicated the hopscotch and marble games were all set
up.  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Thank you again for coming to my rescue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austin&rsquo;s large grin told me I was welcome. After he helped me down from his horse, I
sped toward Aunt Marie and Woody waiting on their porch. I&rsquo;d already greeted the
twins, but they could tell how glad I was to see them again. All of us looked forward
to our usual games.</p>

<p>We walked inside. The ham sandwiches their aunt had made had been carefully cut so
that all of us could share them. Woody had made lemonade.</p>

<p>We sat down at the large table with a long bench on each side. Aunt Marie and Uncle
Roy had six children in all - four now living. Uncle Roy had died several years ago,
but Aunt Marie had done a fine job of raising her children alone. It helped to be so
near her sister, Flora, and Grandma and Grandpa. Years ago, Grandpa had built both
their houses and he enjoyed their living near him. His large family meant a lot to
him.</p>

<p>Austin insisted on taking me home on his horse. After we got as far as Grandpa&rsquo;s
workshop, I asked him to let me walk the rest of the way. I sorta wanted to check
out the Smokehouse to see all those hams Cary said were always hanging in there.</p>

<p>As I walked slowly along, I observed the back of my grandparents&rsquo; house, always amazed
that my Grandfather built the house - much of it with his own hands. It looked as if
it would last forever.</p>

<p>I reached the Smokehouse and carefully opened the squeaky old door. After I adjusted
my eyes to the semi-dark room, I saw with wonder that it did indeed contain many hams
hung on hooks. I wondered how many of them were country hams - my favorite!</p>

<p>Just as I was having visions of country ham, red-eye gravy and some of Grandma&rsquo;s
wonderful hot biscuits, I heard the sickening sound of that ancient door closing. I
ran toward it, but I was too late! I was locked in this eerie place and no one even
knew I was in here.</p>

<p>I was getting more panicky by the minute when suddenly I heard Austin&rsquo;s voice telling
me he&rsquo;d get me out in a hurry. I was filled with relief - how in the world did he
know I was in here?</p>

<p>The door slowly creaked open. Austin poked his head in and said, &ldquo;I turned around to
make sure you got home all right. Then I saw the old door to the Smokehouse closing
and I took a chance you were inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First the snake and now this! You must think I can&rsquo;t stay out of trouble,&rdquo; I said,
still shuddering at the thought ofhow I might have fared if Austin had not spotted me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so at all,&rdquo; Austin assured me. &ldquo;You are an intelligent young lady
with an inquiring mind. I&rsquo;m just glad I saw the door close on you when I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess now Grandpa will recognize the necessity to replace that old lock with a new
one. Well I promise you one thing. From now on, when Grandma tells me to be home at
five, I won&rsquo;t go poking around by myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austin said, &ldquo;This is a very large farm and too many things can happen if you are
alone. You&rsquo;ve made a wise decision. would you like to help me water my horse?&rdquo;
Austin asked gently. &ldquo;His name is Perkins. Weird name, but the man I bought him from
when he was a colt had already named him. Sorta suits him,&rdquo; Austin smiled. &ldquo;Well how
about it? Old Perkins is awfully thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that. May I draw the water from the well, too?&rdquo; I asked excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe next year, after you have grown a little more. That old bucket is pretty
heavy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austin carefully placed the bucket on the rim of the water trough so that I could
have the fun of seeing Perkins eagerly consuming the cool water. Being a builder,
Grandpa had planned each detail of his home, even to the larger-than-normal water
trough.</p>

<p>Perkins turned his head after getting his fill of the well water as if to thank me
for my kindness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that Perkins is satisfied I&rsquo;ll just draw another bucket of water so that any of the
farm hands can water their horses with no delay. I can&rsquo;t draw a bucket ahead for the
workers, because the cool fresh water from the well is halfthe iov of stopping by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the other half?&rdquo; I asked impishly.</p>

<p>Our little Grandma, of course. She seems to make extra country ham biscuits and comes
out with some when somebody stops by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that. How kind of her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a great little lady,&rdquo; Austin said with ride in his voice. Our Grandparents had
trusted him with a very responsible job that would allow him to be at home at the
same time. His mother&rsquo;s home is only a short distance away from Grandpa&rsquo;s home. Aunt
Marie is his mother as well as the twins and Woody.</p>

<p>Austin had decided to take this morning break; and he suggested we move to the large
porch swing that Grandpa had built so many years ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;does Grandpa own all that land?&rdquo; I pointed to the rich bottom land near the creek
and beyond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He hired me as Overseer while he is working as a builder in Commerce and
Maysville. He loves to live on this farm, but his real love is building houses. I
really find it a challenge to oversee their large farm. It has given me an
independence that I could not have found otherwise. I truly do take pride in years
with good crops. Grandpa gives me a fair percentage of the income from the farm in
good years, and he takes care ofme in the rare bad years. you can see, it works out
well for both of us,&rdquo; Austin added sincerely.</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="heavenly-aroma">Heavenly Aroma</h1>

<p>When I forced myself awake, my head was whirling with the events of yesterday. First the snake -
ugh! - then the wonderful fun at the twins&rsquo; house. I smiled happily before remembering the
terriffing experience of being locked in that Smokehouse. Before I could get too involved in my
thoughts, an aroma I could not mistake filled my nostrils.  &ldquo;Country Ham!&rdquo; I cried.  I threw on my
clothes and quickly ran down the stairs to the kitchen.  &ldquo;Is that Country Ham I smell cooking? M-m-m
and Red Eye Grary with biscuits, too. Oh. Grandma, I love you!&rdquo; Grandma grinned widely and winked at
Grandpa. &ldquo;Me, too.&rdquo; She said still smiling.  After eating entirely too much, I said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat
enough of this country ham! I love it.&rdquo; Grandpa sai{ &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another thing we have in common. I
could eat this ham every meal.&rdquo; Grandma said briskly, &ldquo;Katie, get your hands washed. I have a chore
for you.&rdquo; My heart sank. How could I do chores after such a wonderful breakfast?  Aloud, I said
meekly, &ldquo;Yes Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; When I had washed and dried my hands carefully, I returned to find Grandma with
her churn for making butter waiting for me.  &ldquo;Oh, Grandma. Is this my chore?&rdquo; I had watched my
sister, Mickey, churn the butter many time for Grandma, but this was the first time I&rsquo;d ever been
allowed to perform such an important task. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe it when you told me yesterday you&rsquo;d
teach me how to chum.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hard; itjust takes a lot ofpatience to wait until the butter
appears on the handle. I usually read my Bible while I&rsquo;m churning.&rdquo; Grandma said almost softly.
&ldquo;Mickey said you have read the Bible all the way through four times! Is that really true?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have
indeed. As you know, I raised our nine children and they required a lot of milk. Our three cows
produced enough milk to keep us all healthy. That required churning every day to keep up, and I read
my Bible each morning. Now, of course, with just your Grandpa and me, we need only one cow; and I
chum three times a week.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you read your Bible every day anyway?&rdquo; I asked somewhat timidly.  &ldquo;Oh,
yes,&rdquo; Grandma said quickly, &ldquo;I read some each day when I have to go upstairs every afternoon to
rest. My doctor has insisted that I rest for two hours after lunch. I have a tendency for migraine
headaches, and I have found the daily rest keeps me from having them so often.&rdquo; &ldquo;What will I do
while you are resting? Shall I read the book I brought with me?&rdquo; I was rather eager to get started
on &ldquo;Heidi&rdquo; and welcomed a quiet time to enjoy that. It seemed as if Grandma was going to rest for a
couple of hours every day, and I realized sadly that I should have brought several ofmy favorite
books.  &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe you have read the Bible so many times. I&rsquo;m number one most of the
time in Bible drills. You know, we have contests to see who can find a particular verse in a book of
the Bible the fastest. That is easy for me, but I&rsquo;ve never read the whole Bible - even once.&rdquo; I said
in awe of Grandma&rsquo;s accomplishment.  Soon, I was churning away, almost too vigorously at first to be
able to have the stamina to last until the magic butter appeared. Grandma had told me the milk she&rsquo;d
put in the churn was &ldquo;clabbered&rdquo; as was required to make butter. It was only later that I learned
what clabbered meant.  As I sat there tiring rapidly, I decided I must churn more slowly in order to
finish my task. I slowed my pace and looked out over my Grandparents&rsquo; large farm. At least, I looked
at the part I could see from my limited vantage point. I remembered the large barn and the ample
chicken house, to say nothing of the outhouse a distance away. I&rsquo;d never really get used to the
outdoor &ldquo;plumbing.&rdquo; Howeveq it was so much fun visiting in the country, I could excuse the lack of a
few modem conveniences!  I looked off into the distance and located Cary and Mary&rsquo;s house. Their
sister, Woody, is my sisteq Mickey&rsquo;s age, lacking a year. Sometimes, all of us had fun together; but
mostly, I played with Cary and Mary, and when Buck was with us, he joined our group.  I looked up on
the hill, and saw Aunt Flora and Uncle Pate&rsquo;s house. I looked carefully, and actually saw a slight
movement on their porch; and I instinctively knew that was Aunt Flora rocking back and forth. I
could almost see her chewing her usual gum and looking off into the distance with a worried look on
her face. Many times I had wondered what concerned her so.  I glanced down at the churn, and
suddenly I saw small bits of butter come up with the handle. &ldquo;Grandma,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I see butter on
the handle! It&rsquo;s just like you said. It&rsquo;s small, but I see it!&rdquo; I was so excited.  &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve got
it. It is always so exciting when the first butter appears; and you realize you have created this
yourself. It is worth waiting for.&rdquo; &ldquo;When can I churn again?&rdquo; I cried.  &ldquo;In a couple of days.
Remember I no longer have my nine children at home, and now we have only one cow. I still have to
mile her every day, but I store the milk in our cool cellar. We are able to drink whatever milk we
need and &lsquo;clabber&rsquo; the rest for butter and buttermilk.&rdquo; I was thoughtful for a moment as now I
realized why she always told us at meals to &ldquo;sip the milk along with your vittles.&rdquo; She was saving
the rest of that generous supply for making butter. Fascinating!  &ldquo;Grandma, I didnl go up to get my
book to read while I was churning.&rdquo; looked out over the farm and remembered the fun we&rsquo;d had in past
summers. The time passed very quickly.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said that with your vivid imagination, someday
you&rsquo;ll be a writer.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you really think so, Grandma?&rdquo; I asked thoughtfully.  &ldquo;You have the
temperament and the colorful flair for using words.&rdquo; Grandma finished almost proudly.  &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll
just start keeping a few notes in the notebook I brought with me. Who knows - someday, I&rsquo;ll be glad
I did.&rdquo; I said and decided that was a good idea.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always fun to keep a sort of diary,&rdquo; said
Grandma. Now let&rsquo;s get the churn into the kitchen. We have to separate the butter from the liquid.
You&rsquo;ve not only made butter, you&rsquo;ve also made buttermilk.  Grandma expertly (out of long practice)
poured the buttermilk into containers and molded the butter into pats large enough for our daily
use. She solemnly poured two glasses of the fresh buttermilk for us to enjoy.  &ldquo;Better make that
three glasses, Mattie,&rdquo; said Grandpa. I&rsquo;m off to work, but I love buttermilk almost as much as
Country Ham.&rdquo; All three of us eagerly drank the delicious milk. I&rsquo;d never particularly cared for
buttermilk, but I made this myself&rsquo;! I asked for another glass. Not to be outdone, my Grandpa joined
me.  Grandma was very pleased at my first churning experience. Her plan was working.</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="what-a-thunderstorm">What A Thunderstorm</h1>

<p>It was about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. I was sleeping soundly on my pallet in a remote corner of
the vast upstairs room. Grandma and Grandpa were asleep in their bed in the opposite corner of the
room. All during the summers, they slept upstairs to take advantage of the cool breezes that wafted
from the large windows in all four sides of the huge room. Normally, it was very pleasant.  When I
heard the tremendous clap of thunder, I was so frightened I instinctively ran toward Grandma&rsquo;s side
of their bed and jumped in beside her! I was petrified and did not wait for an invitation.  Grandma
put a comforting arm around me and said, &lsquo;All of our nine children, sometimes several at a time,
used to hop into our bed during a bad thunderstorm. The storms seem so much worse in this large room
with all the windowsl&rdquo; Grandpa said soothingly, &ldquo;This one will be over soon, Sugar Babe. You&rsquo;ll
see.&rdquo; With every terrible clap of thunder that was followed by piercing lightening, I burrowed
further down under the covers.  Grandma finally announced&rdquo; &ldquo;OK, Katie, the storms all over. You can
come up for air now.&rdquo; I sheepishly emerged from the covers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I got so frightened,
Grandma. I guess you are right about all those windows. When the lightening was so bad, it felt like
I was bound to be the next victim.&rdquo; &ldquo;That kind offierce lightening rarely strikes houses around
here. Remembeq we have several effective lightening rods on our property,&rdquo; Grandpa said trying to
reassure me.  &ldquo;lf you say so, Grandpa,&rdquo; I said&rdquo; not at all convinced it could not have struck us in
our beds!  &ldquo;lf it is any comfort to you, Katie, these really bad storms only happen about once a
month or less during the summer. We have lesser storms at other times that hardly wake us up.&rdquo;
Grandma watched my face to see if I was comforted.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they don&rsquo;t come real often. It&rsquo;s not
like me to come running and jump into someone&rsquo;s bed because I got so scared.&rdquo; &ldquo;Think nothing of it.
Like I said, all of our children came running to our bed for comfort when the bad storms came. Now
letS try to go back to sleep. We have a big day tomorrow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I said and wondered what
chores she had planned for me. So faq Mary and Cary&rsquo;s warnings last summer to me about too many
chores were ￼wrong. Grandrna had helped me do the dishes, shs had let me churn, and she
ha allowed me to gather the eggs, All of these things I really enjoyed especially the churning.
&lsquo;iVhen ttrat butter appeared on the handle. I was so excited! I was beginning to suspect that I had
better stop listening to my cousins and decide for myself whether or not Grandma gave me too many
chores.</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="am-i-really-homesick">Am I Really Homesick?</h1>

<p>When I awoke after the horrible thunderstorms that occurred during the night, I
realized, I was feeling a little homesick. I missed my whole family - especially my
brother, Buck. We were very near the same age, and we enjoyed doing so many things
together. I am a little over two years older than he. Grandma and Grandpa had been
wonderful to me, but now I have this miserable feeling that I would rather be home!
Next time, I just won&rsquo;t come alone. Some of the excuses I heard about not coming with
me were pretty weak, anylvay.  I slowly went down the stairs to the kitchen for
breakfast. No aroma of Country Ham this morning! When I entered the kitchen, I saw
three large oatmeal bowls with spoons on the table. Three glasses of milk were
already poured beside the bowls. Grandpa was already seated at the table drinking his
coffee.  &ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; I said not too cheerfully.  &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Grandma and Grandpa
said in unison.  &ldquo;Grandpa, I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;m homesick and I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you
would call my Daddy to come and get me tomorrow after he gets off work. I am just not
used to coming alone. Would you do that for me?&rdquo; I looked sadly at him.  &ldquo;Are you
sure, Sugar Babe? I thought we were having a great time together.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having fun,
but I miss all my family.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you have all day to make up your mind - really. If
you still want to go home by tonight, I&rsquo;ll call your Daddy to pick you up. Better
still, I will take you home myself!&rdquo; Grandpa knew his fast driving scared me.  &ldquo;Oh
no! That won&rsquo;t be necessary. Daddy can come and get me,&rdquo; I said too quickly.  Grandpa
winked at Grandma. They both knew I would never ride as far as Gainesville with
Grandpa. I had been in his speeding car before - many times! Grandma broke into our
conversation. &ldquo;Eat your oatrneal, Katie. As soon as you finish, I&rsquo;ll have the churn
all set up for you on the porch. Ifyou finished that last book you were reading, you
may want to get one out of the parlor.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; I said eagerly. I had forgotten
this was the day to churn. I ate my oatmeal in a hurry and soon had my book. I was
all set to do my favorite chore.  As I started out on the porch to settle down to
churn, Grandma said to me, &ldquo;The butter on your oatmeal this morning was what you
churned a couple of days ago.&rdquo; ￼ &ldquo;Was it really? I thought it tasted
especially good.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry the snake frightened you so! Austin and I couldn&rsquo;t
remember how long it had been since one was found on our farm. Quite a while, I
believe. I&rsquo;m so glad it was a non-poisonous one. Any snake can scare me. I hate those
things,&rdquo; Grandma said.  &ldquo;Me, too. Austin killed him with just one shot!&rdquo; I said.  &ldquo;He
is a very accurate hunter. He is much admired by his peers because it usually takes
him just one shot. When you finish churning, would you like to gather the eggs for
me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yes. Next to churning, I always wanted to collect the eggs. By the way,
Grandma, I think I&rsquo;m all over my homesickness. Let&rsquo;s just tell Grandpa when he comes
homc that I&rsquo;ve decided to stay for my fu1l visit.&rdquo; &ldquo;l&rsquo;m so glad. Grandpa will be
glad, too. Both of us are really enjoying having you with us. Since you came alone
this year, you and I are having a chance to become better acquainted. That means a
lot to me,&rdquo; Grandma said seriously.  &ldquo;lt does to me, too, Grandma.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now read your
book while you churn, and I&rsquo;ll get the dishes washed and clean up the kitchen.&rdquo; When
Grandpa returned home, both Grandma and I were eager to tell him that I had decided
to stay.  &ldquo;Sugar Babe, that makes me very happy! After supper, I want to teach you
how to play horseshoes - Grandpa style! That is something you can practice by
yourself or play with someone. I have a feeling you&rsquo;ll become very good at
horseshoes!&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious to learn,&rdquo; I said eagerly, knowing what a champion Grandpa
is known to be.  After supper, Grandpa and I went out to the place where the
horseshoes were waiting. Before he left this morning, Grandpa had put the two pairs
of horseshoes in readiness for us to play.  Grandpa explained that there were two
methods of pitching horseshoes. One was to turn the shoes over and over, and the
other was to furn the shoes round and round. Your Daddy, I believe, turns his over
and over. You look like a round and round player like me!&rdquo; I tried both methods and
found that I was indeed a round and round playerl Grandpa threw a few ringers here
and there, and suddenly I had a ringer!  &ldquo;Grandpa do you see that? I have a ringer! I
actually have a ringerl&rdquo; &ldquo;Now you are getting the hang of it. Soon you will have lots
of ringers. Now you practice a while. I have some paper work to do. Try to practice
at least an hour, and by tomorrow, you&rsquo;ll be able to take on Cary and Mary.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you
really think so? They are pretty good, so they tell me.&rdquo; I said eagerly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
key - so they tell you.&rdquo; Grandpa said lightly.  After about thirty minutes, I found
that I was getting about one ringer out of three. &ldquo;Either Grandpa is a great teacher,
or I have a real </p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="the-old-chicken-house">The Old Chicken House</h1>

<p>Of all the chores Grandma assigned me to do - next to churning - I really enjoyed
collecting the eggs. Grandma had always trusted Mickey with this task, but Mickey was
not here, and she had to ask me.  The old hen house was usually neat and clean, which
was a surprise considering it was a hen house! The only real challenge in this place
was the old red hen who always wanted to hang on to her eggs. All of the other hens
seemed to understand we would take the eggs regardless, so they put up no resistance.
&ldquo;Ole Red&rdquo; was another story!  I took Ole Red as a personal challenge. When I
carefully eased my hand to take her egg, she always pecked at me. It didn&rsquo;t really
hurt, but sometimes it scared me. Always it irritated me. Grandpa had shown me just
how to handle heE but still she was trouble. He said she wanted to sit on the eggs so
that she could have just one more brood of chickens. Grandpa said she was too old
now, but no one could convince her!  Ole Red&rsquo;s eggs were always different from the
others. They were not only brown, but had a slight reddish tint as well.  Grandma
called me into the kitchen. &ldquo;Did you finally get &ldquo;Ole Red&rdquo; to give up her egg?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
did Grandma, but every day, it gets harder. She is really stubborn. The young hen you
told me started laying this year is the best hen. She seems to give me her eggs with
a little pride.&rdquo; &ldquo;That helps,&rdquo; Grandma smiled. &ldquo;Are Mary and Cary coming over in time
for lunch when they come to play Monopoly with you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I sorta asked them to - I hope
that is all right with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is this time. I just made up some egg salad from
part of yesterdays eggs. In the future, you must ask me first to be sure that I have
enough food for lunch on hand.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am. I was just so anxious to be sure they
would come. With the new tips that Grandpa gave me last night on Monopoly, I just
might beat them for a change. They must really play that game a lot,&rdquo; I said.  &ldquo;On
rainy days, and it gets so dark so early in the wintertime, they even enjoy playing
by lamp light. Marie makes sure they finish their homework first.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mickey is pretty
good at Monopoly, but she and Irene consider Buck and me too young to present a
challenge to them. Maybe after this sumrner, I can show them how much better I can
play.&rdquo; &ldquo;Grandpa must have really given you some fine pointers,&rdquo; Grandma said mildly.
I quickly looked at Graudma to b9 sure that was not a sarcastic remarh but her
expression was kind.  &lsquo;ollere eomc the trrins,&rdquo; I said excitedly and ças glad to
close that conversation.  After a nice lunch, whichincluded a fbw oiher tbingq
Graodma decided to acld, we settled dorryn to play Monopoly. [t wasnt too long before
the garne turned into tny favor and I niumphantly beat both ofmy cousins soundly;

<p>When I awoke one morning, there was a bustle of activity in the kitchen. Grandma
greeted me with, &ldquo;Katie, this is washday. As soon as you have finished your oatmeal,
please bring me all your dirty clothes. Here is a bag to put them ln..  &ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
I said obediently. After I had my dirty clothes neatly in the bag, Grandma took my
bag and hers downstairs. I followed her and I looked around puzzled. I asked Grandma,
&ldquo;Where is your washing machine?&rdquo; Grandma sort of grinned and said&rdquo; &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m it!,&rsquo;
&ldquo;l don&rsquo;t understand&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;Would you please fetch that
large bar of Lye soap fiom the pantry shelfl We&rsquo;ll also need the washboard leaning in
the corner of the pantry. I&rsquo;ll go on out in the yard by those big stones and wait for
you while I sort the clothes.  I stared at Grandma for a moment. I just could not
understand why we would be &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; out in the yard with our dirty laundry! No way
did it make any sense to me that we could be able to wash our clothes without a
washing machine. And I was looking forward to wringing the clothes out on the wringei
My mother always let me do that on washday.  As I went down into the yard, I noticed
Grandma had filled two laree tubs with water from the well by the side porch. I
figured I must have dawdled-a little getting the items Grandma needed because I
couldn&rsquo;t see how she had possibly had time to fill the tubs in my absence.  Grandma
read my thoughts and said, &ldquo;Grandpa always draws the water for me on washdays before
he goes into town to work.&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how you had moved so
fast! Now, what can I do to help? I knoq I can wring the clothes out on the wringer -
except that I don&rsquo;t see a wringer!&rdquo; Grandma held out her two strong hands and said,
,.1 am the wringer. you can wash the small items.&rdquo; She placed the washboard in one of
the tubs and demonstrated how to use it.  I decided all the work was with elbow
power, but it looked like fun, so I rubbed away. After a few Knuckle scrapes, I
finally got the hang of it. I was glad she only let me wash the small items because
soon my arms became very tired.  Grandma said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good, Katie. Now we have
to put all these clothes into the other tub to rinse them. I will wring them out and
hang them on the lines to dry.&rdquo; I was busy rinsing my small items when I heard behind
me a sharp banging noise! I quickly turned to see Grandma with a wide paddle in her
hand seeming to beat the heck out ofseveral pieces oflaundry! The clothes were wet
and soapy, and were draped over one of the large rocks&rsquo; Grandma looked at my face and
laughed out loud! &ldquo;This is my special stain remover - works every time!&rdquo; I laughed
too - so hard in fact that my stomach hurt! Grandma&rsquo;s primitive method of washing
clothes with homemade Lye soap was indeed strange. Later, when the clothes dried in
the warm sunshine, I had to admit I&rsquo;d never seen clothes so WHITE. Grandma&rsquo;s wash day
had been a fascinating experience!</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="alone">Alone</h1>

<p>The first week of my visit had progressed more rapidly than I ha expected. I became
aware that the pet peeve I had against Grandma was missing! She had not said one word
about the way I walk being a habit. She has always known that I d experienced a light
case of Polio when I was eighteen months old. I have always walked so close to normal
that she always took it upon herself to see that I had a 100% perfect gait. This
visit, however, not only had she failed to nag me about my walking, I had not even
caught her looking at my feet - not once! I wondered why - as that was the main
reason I never was very fond of her.  I started really noticing; and sure enough,
Grandma treated me as if I&rsquo;d never had a walking problem at all. My left ankle was
weak when I was tired, and when I was very tired, that foot and ankle showed
weakness, but my mother said that was from the fall she said paralyzed me at eighteen
months.  What was she trying to do to me? Make me like her? The thought was not
unpleasant, but just new to me.  I thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to admire the way Grandma can
play Checkers! If I hadn&rsquo;tjust learned those two new moves Grandpa taught me, shed
have beaten me good. My respect for her grew a little.  Just what did she mean when
she said to me as an afterthought, &ldquo;Tomorrow after our chores are over, I want to
show you a special little pair of scissors.&rdquo; Whose scissors? What was she up to now?
I&rsquo;d just have to wait and see. All of us grandchildren had learned you do not hurry
one ofGrandma&rsquo;s surprises. Still, I couldn&rsquo;t help being a little curious.  I finally
finished my churning, and Grandma called me in to her sewing room.  &ldquo;I have to sew on
a few buttons today. I&rsquo;ve been putting this offtoo long.&rdquo; (I thought to myself, &ldquo;l
can&rsquo;t imagine Grandma ever putting anything off!&rdquo; &ldquo;While you are here with me, I want
to tell you that someday these scissors will be yours,&rdquo; she blurted out, not savoring
the surprise.  I tried to look appreciative, but all I saw was a very old pair of
scissors.  &ldquo;What makes these so special?&rdquo; I carefully asked.  Grandma looked at my
face and laughed. &ldquo;You see, the thing that makes these scissors so special is that I
am the fourth generation who has owned them. They are not pretty, but they cut good&rdquo;
and I get quite a satisfaction out of knowing they were bought by my great
grandmother for her little sewing basket. When I use my scissors, I find myself
wondering just what sort of fashions they had back then. Did she also lose a button
now and then. and use these scissors to clip the threads?  &ldquo;The scissors have always
been a pleasure for me because I couldjust picture how they had been similarly used
by my ancestors, to keep all their mending done,&rdquo; Grandma smiled wistfully.  I looked
incredulously at my little Grandma. I could not believe that she could ever have such
sentimental thoughts.  &ldquo;I had not even considered such use of the scissors. I&rsquo;m afraid
all I saw was that they were very old. Grandma, it is really very sweet of you to
want me to have your special scissors. Someday, I shall use them with pride now that
I know their history.&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my girl!&rdquo; Grandma said softly. &ldquo;By the way, don&rsquo;t you
sort of wonder why I chose YOU to get my little historic scissors? I have a host of
granddaughters, you know.&rdquo; Grandma smiled at me in a special sort of way.  &ldquo;Yes.
Ma&rsquo;am, I did wonder, and I came to the conclusion that of all of them, I am the most
like you!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe I had made such a confession, but it was true!  Grandma
took my hand for just the slightest moment and squeezed it lightly.  I smiled at the
wonderment of finally admitting the truth. In fact, up until this moment, I had not
put this thought into words.  &ldquo;Grandma, not long ago, Mama and Daddy were talking
about Grandpa&rsquo;s father, Cumberland Reynolds, you know the one that was in the Civil
War. Did his wife ever use these little scissors?&rdquo; Grandma could not help smiling at
my lengthy sentences for one so young, but she answered me kindly. &ldquo;No, Dear. These
came from my family, The Epps. I&rsquo;ll have to tell you more about them sometime.
Perhaps a little while you are here.&rdquo; Grandma said her patience was wearing a little
thin, so she suggested that we eo fold a few clothes. I wasn&rsquo;t fooled. She was
sentimental after all!</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="no-longer-petrified">No Longer Petrified</h1>

<p>One afternoon, I was swinging in the large swing on my Grandparents&rsquo; porch. I was reading
a book out of Grandpa&rsquo;s library. I looked up and out across the vast countryside. How
peaceful and quiet the large farm appeared. I had been here for almost two weeks, and I
was sad to think I would soon be going home.  When I had packed my clothes to come here,
the only way my parents had been able to persuade me to visit alone was to assure me that
there was NO RECORD OF A TORNADO EVER HITTING ANY PART OF THIS COUNTY IN GEORGIA!  &ldquo;Mama,
are you sure they don&rsquo;t have tornadoes?&rdquo; I had asked again. I was very worried. I was
still acutely aware of the severe thunderstorms that seemed to occur with the regularity
of at least once a week in our home of Gainesville, Georgia. That had been the case ever
since the horrendous Twin Tornadoes had devastated our city on April 6, 1936 - two months
ago, to be exact.  Our Mother and I lived in constant terror that another tornado would
strike and wipe us all offthe face of the earthl The others in our family were frightened
by the big weekly storms, ofcourse; but they did not seem to be as petrified as my Mother
and I were. Maybe they did not talk about their fears as much.  Reluctantly, I had agreed
to go and spend two weeks by myself with our Grandparents so that I would have a change
ofscenery. I don&rsquo;t think anyone took into consideration that I was not very fond of my
little Grandmother! I adored my Grandfather, though, so I felt that I could enjoy being
with him each night when he came home from his building business in Commerce.  At eighteen
months, I had a slight case ofPolio; and at eleven years, I still did not walk to suit my
Grandmother! She was always telling me that the way I walked was &lsquo;Just habit.&rdquo; That made
me rather miserable at times. I didnl exactly dislike her - I just wished she&rsquo;d let me
walk in peace.  As I continued to swing slowly, I was amazed to discover, as I thought
about it, I was gradually becoming rather fond of my Grandma. I remembered how much I
enjoyed chuming the butter. She had let me do that when I first came to visit them; and it
had become my special chore. I liked to finally see the pieces ofbutter on the dash; but I
had also been able to read a number ofbooks while I performed this necessary chore. I
could well understand how Grandma had been able to read the Bible through four times.
Amazing! I suspect she also read considerably when her doctor made her rest for a couple
of hours after lunch each day. Grandma was not the type to nap while resting; so her
reading was undisturbed.  &ldquo;l&rsquo;11 be bored to pieces every day while Grandma is upstairs
resting,&rdquo; I thought to myself when I first arrived. However, I had always enjoyed reading,
and I found it fascinating to be able to select books from Grandpa&rsquo;s library. While
looking over some of the children&rsquo;s books, I fancied that some were ones my own Mother had
read as a child. I was pretty sure I recognized her handwriting in the margins of some of
the books I picked out to read. I found it interesting that many of the ones I enjoyed
were ones I realized my Mother had also read before me. It was easy to calculate her age
as she was born in 1900.  I remembered with pride that Grandma had taught me to cook
Country Ham and Red Eye Gravy. Grandpa had been so pleased the first time I cooked that
meal. We both enjoy that combination very much.  I could never get over the fascination I
felt with being able to cook so many items at the same time on the large old wood stove.
Once it was hot, everything could be cooked at once, even the grits Grandma had also
taught me how to cook.  For some reason, I thought of the horseshoe games I d enjoyed so
much this trip, particularly after Grandpa showed me how he played&rsquo; With practice&rsquo; I had
become so accurate with my ringers not many had been able to defeat me, at least not for
long. That was one game I really excelled in, and it meant a lot to me to do something so
well.  Deep in thought, I had not heard Grandma quietly come through the screen door. She
stood there for a moment, then said&rdquo; &ldquo;Want company?&rdquo; I looked up and smiled my welcome.
&ldquo;l&rsquo;ve just been swinging slowly and thinking of all the things I have done and learned in
the past two weeks, Grandma! It seems I have been here longer than two weeks because we
have done so much and I have learned so much from you and Grandpa.&rdquo; &ldquo;I hope you are
enjoying your time with us,&rdquo; Grandma said softly&rsquo; &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; I said quickly. &ldquo;Besides
churning, I&rsquo;m so glad you taught me how to cook Country Ham and Red Eye Gravy.&rdquo; &ldquo;You learn
so quickly, Katie, and Grandpa and I are so happy you came alone. It has given us a chance
to get to know you better. Grandpa is always telling his friends that he taught you to
play horseshoes - his style. He said that now you even beat him most of the time,&rdquo; Grandma
said pleasantly&rsquo; &ldquo;Does he really tell them I beat him? I didnl at first, but now I do beat
him a lot and I can tell he is trying hard!&rdquo; &ldquo;Katie, you are not as anxious now when the
thunderstonns come&rsquo; are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;No Ma&rsquo;am. I only jumped into your bed out of terror that
first time. I&rsquo;ve learned that they really will pass in a few minutes. They still scare me,
but I guess they scare a lot ofpeople, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; &ldquo;sometimes I&rsquo;m petrified!&rdquo; Grandma
admitted. &ldquo;Even though the lightening and thunder are never pleasant, most of the time, we
feel the lightening rods do their jobs. At least, it helps to think they do! The rains do
help keep the crops growing,&rdquo; Grandma added thoughtfu lly.  I said - very grown-up like,
&ldquo;You just have to grin and bear it until a storm is overl&rdquo; &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s the idea!&rdquo; Grandma
said approvingly. &ldquo;Before I came out, I set out two glasses for us to enjoy some of the
buttermilk you made this morning. Want some?&rdquo; &ldquo;You bet I do!&rdquo; Since I had been churning
the butter, I had learned to real.ly enjoy the buttermilk. It almost tasted sweet after
all that work.  I felt a definite relief to discuss the thunderstorms with Grandma. and to
admit to her and to myself that the temendous fear IT felt after the tornado was waning
rapidly. Perhaps I&rsquo;d grown up a little in my toleration of one of natures drastic
elements!</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="her-chocolate-cake-is-fantastic">Her Chocolate Cake Is Fantastic</h1>

<p>We waved goodbye to Grandpa and watched his trail ofred dust as he drove rapidly to Commerce.
Grandma turned to me and said, &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s time to gather the eggs. Would you please go to the pantry
and bring the basket?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, by the way, Grandpa and I want to take you Saturday afternoon to
Wilson&rsquo;s Church to the dinner on the grounds. I will need to make one of my chocolate cakes and a
churn of ice cream. I need as many eggs as possible by tomorrow morning. We should have no trouble
there as all our hens are good layers.&rdquo; I was so excited over the homemade ice cream and chocolate
cake that I ran out with the basket to get all the eggs I could find in the hen house.  Grandma
watched me with a big smile on her face. &ldquo;Her enthusiasm proves shet beginning to enjoy her visit
alone,&rdquo; Grandma thought and was pleased.  In a very short time, I appear4d in the kitchen doorway
with a beaming smile. &ldquo;Grandma, will sixteen eggs be enough for your cake and the ice cream? That
sixteenth egg wasn&rsquo;t easy for me to get as &ldquo;Ole Red&rdquo; really wanted to keep it! &ldquo; . &ldquo;That is more
than enough,&rdquo; Grandma said, and I was so happy. &ldquo;Ole Red&rdquo; really doesn&rsquo;t like to part with her eggs.
She squawks pretty loud sometimes. I have an idea, though, most of the time, her squawk is worse
than her peckl&rdquo; I chuckled at Grandma&rsquo;s attempt at humor.  Soon Grandma made her famous chocolate
cake and she had let me help with the homemade ice cream. I did fine until, along toward the last,
the handle of the freezer became so hard to turn that I couldn&rsquo;t budge it. Grandma came to help me.
She sai{ &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a finejob. I was able to get the cake packed in my cake box, and I put a few
snacks in a bag for us to eat in the wagon on the way.&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, Grandma. You remembered last
year, you wished we&rsquo;d had something to munch on as the wagon takes so long to get to church. It&rsquo;s
fun, though. I like to dangle my legs offthe back and sing along with the others. We had such a good
time last year.&rdquo; &ldquo;Marie told me that she and Mary and Cary are coming, too. At the last minute,
Woody decided to go with us. We&rsquo;ll have a nice crowd in the wagon, and enough to really enjoy
singing as we ride,&rdquo; Grandma said.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad they are all coming. It won&rsquo;t be quite the same
without Mickey and Buck, but they couldn&rsquo;t come this year.&rdquo; Austin appeared from the barn. He had
filled the wagon with soft hay. He also had hitched Nellie Belle up with his own horse, Perkins,
securely to the wagon. It was noon, and as soon as Grandpa arrived home, we would be on our way.
Grandpa was rarely late.  I looked down the road towards Commerce, and sure enough, I spotted a
continuous cloud of dust which I knew was my Grandpa&rsquo;s speeding car! In no time at all, Grandpa was
seated on the high wagon seat ready to guide us to Wilson&rsquo;s Church. Many years ago, he&rsquo;d tried to
whip the horses into speeding, but Grandma had quickly put a stop to that! She told him that half
the fun of riding in the wagon to the church was the leisurely pace so that the singing would be
enjoyed by all.  Grandpa got down and lifted his small wife up into the place beside him on the
buckboard seat. &ldquo;Everyone pile in andbe seated,&rsquo;Said Grandpa.  One by one, we climbed into the wagon
with Austin&rsquo;s help. Soon we were all comfortably seated. Mary Cary, and I were already dangling our
feet off the back. I looked back and saw that Woody wanted to be back there with us, but there was
not quite enough room. She settled down just behind us. I turned to Woody and sai{ &ldquo;Woody, I think I
can move over just a little, and you can just squeeze in.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nah, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When we start
singing, it will be easier for me to harmonize since I&rsquo;m in the middle.&rdquo; &ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; I asked, still
feeling guilty to be sitting in the best place in the wagon.  &ldquo;Yep, enjoy it. Next year, Mickey and
I will sit there!&rdquo; She grinned at me.  Grandma started singing some rounds and we all happily joined
in. We sang one after another. Then we started our favorite hymns. As Grandma said when we started
the hymns, &lsquo;After all, we are riding to the church!&rdquo; After we arrived at Wilson&rsquo;s Church, we
realized we were among the last to get there. Grandpa expertly released the horses from the wagon
and hitched them to a nearby tree. We would be there a while; and the horses needed freedom from the
traces.  Grandma said, &ldquo;If everyone will take one or two items, we can get our food to the table
quickly.&rdquo; Most of the people may have gotten there ahead of the Reynolds clan, but no one dared use
their usual table. Grandma and Grandpa were both important pillars of the church, and everyone
respected their chosen table as for their use only. After all, Grandma was known as the greatest
student of the Bible in the entire congregation. It was widely known that she had read the Bible
through four times. Many people went to her for her wise advice when problems occurred in their
lives. Grandpa was an Elder in the church, and had been for more years than most of the people could
remember.  We realized as we were unloading our food from the baskets that almost everyone was ready
to serve theirs. We quickly set our table and the Minister asked Grandpa to say the blessing. His
grace was fairly short as Grandpa, as well as the rest ofus, had worked up a tremendous appetite.
The only noise we heard for a few minutes was the happy consumption of delicious food.  I thought,
&ldquo;This is almost like our family reunions. It will be coming up very soon. I&rsquo;ll be able to &ldquo;Pig Out&rdquo;
twice this summer. This occasion proved to be very pleasant, especially for the adults. It wasn&rsquo;t
long before us kids began to be fidgety, as we were ready for the fun ride back home in the wagon,
We saw that the food was gone and all of the ice cream and cake had disappeared.  Pretty soon,
Grandpa hitched the horses again to the wagon for the ride back to his farm. Everyone elimbed
aboard. I said to Woody, &ldquo;You take my place. I&rsquo;ll sit in the harmonizing section.&rdquo; She protested,
but I insisted. She grinned happily and climbed in, immediately dangling her own feet. The only
thing she had to contend with was being so close to the twins. They always teased her so. She
managed to ignore them and we all had a good ride home. My ride wasn&rsquo;t so bad either; and it was a
good spot for harmonizing!</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="rock-and-worry">Rock And Worry</h1>

<p>One morning after I gathered the eggs, Grandma told me to count out one dozen eggs and put them in a
basket. She said that she wanted me to go with her up the hill to Aunt Flora&rsquo;s house. I immediately
realized that her daughter was the one I had seen for years rocking on her porch. In fact, in
anything but rainy or snowy weather, she could always be seen rocking back and forth aimlessly as if
that were her mission in life. I was mildly excited to be going to visit Aunt Flora with Grandma,
instead of listening to my cousins who always implied that she was just lazily rocking her time
away.  &ldquo;Flora never has enough eggs at one time, and it will be a treat for her.&rdquo; I wondered vaguely
why she never had enough eggs, but I quickly counted a dozen eggs out of the ones I had gathered this
morning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know too much about Aunt Flora,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;From the distance, I always see her
rocking on her front porch a lot.&rdquo; Grandma laughed. &lsquo;And if you could see her up close, you&rsquo;d
observe that she is always chewing her gum with that same worried look on her face. Her worries are
many times justified - bit the creases she has carved as wrinkles in her forehead belie her actual
age. I do know that she worries too much about her boys. Her youngest, in particular, gets a little
too rambunctious at times. Flora is such a gentle soul, she really does not discipline her children
as well as she should. And Pate, her husband, is too easy on them as well.  &ldquo;You remember Flora&rsquo;s
son, Fotch? He never hunts with a gun. He can knock a squirrel out of a tree as quickly as Austin
can with his trusty rifle. It is sometimes arnazingl&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed many times that Camp seems to be
unhappy and restless,&rdquo; I said.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s putting it mildly! He never seems content with his lot in
life. I guess he will outgrow it.&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough theorizing for such a lovely morning. Do we have
everything we need?&rdquo; Grandma was ready to start up the hill.  &ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am, &ldquo;I replied, eager to know
more about my Aunt who logs so much rocking time. &ldquo;Do you think Aunt Flora will let me make the
coffee?&rdquo; I asked almost too eagerly, as Grandma had just yesterday taught me how &ldquo;Flora would let
you clean her house, also, ifyou wanted to. I&rsquo;m afraid she has long strayed from the lady who used
to be proud of the way her home looked. Her worries pre-empt other things these days, and she seems
oblivious to her untidy surroundings. Fotch does the best he can to see that things are livable,
but, after all, he didn&rsquo;t get to be such a sharpshooter with that slingshot while washing dishes!&rdquo;
Grandma said.  &ldquo;Mary told me that Aunt Flora has a son our brother, Curtis&rsquo; age. She says at one
time, they were real close when Curt would visit your farm.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mary is absolutely right. They have
had some good times together. Both are fun-loving young en and each is popular with the young
ladies. Especially your brother, Curtis. His winning personality is great to be around,&rdquo; Grandma
said with a fond twinkle in her eye.  &ldquo;Curt has always been kind to me and never fails, at sometime
during the year to remind me, with a special sort of affection, that he and lrene carried me many a
mile during the six months I could not walk (at eighteen months) when I had my slight case of
Polio,&rdquo; I said with pride because he cared.  &ldquo;Curt and Irene would not allow you to be confined to a
chair. You were such a slender little thing. I even think they grudgingly enjoyed showing you offto
their friends.&rdquo; We were almost to Aunt Flora&rsquo;s front porch by now, andAunt Flora had risen from her
rocking chair and held out her plump arms to her mother.  Grandma was not too much for any show of
emotion, but she quickly enveloped her oldest daughter in a bear hug.  Finally, Aunt Flora noticed
me. &ldquo;Katie, I declare you have grown so much this year that I might not have recognized you if I had
seen you without Mama.&rdquo; I took her remark as a compliment, and returned the mild hug she bestowed on
me.  Flora returned her attention to her mother. &ldquo;Mama, if I&rsquo;d known you were coming, I&rsquo;d have made
a fresh pot of coffee.&rdquo; Grandma and I were acutely aware that Aunt Flora had followed us with her
eyes from the time we left Grandma&rsquo;s house until we approached her porch. Aunt Flora&rsquo;s unhappiness
made her oblivious to her duties as a hostess.  I chirped up, &lsquo;Aunt Flora, Grandma taught me how to
make coffee just yesterday, and I can serve it, too. May I make some for you?&rdquo; Aunt Flora looked at
me begrudging the fact that even at my tender age of eleven, I could accomplish what used to be one
of the joys ofher day.  I disappeared into the very untidy kitchen and proceeded to carefully and
silently wash the coffee pot and the cups we would be using for our coffee. Aunt Flora did not even
seem embarrassed because nothing in the kitchen was clean enough to use.  I could hear Grandma
kindly making conversation that Flora could relate to regarding various activities of the members of
her family. Aunt Flora mentioned in passing that her daughter, Gertrude, had written her a note
inviting her to visit her in Maysville for a few days since she had not been with her too much
lately.  Soon, my coffee was ready, and I carefully put three cups and three napkins on the tray,
and I went back into the living room proudly carrying my coffee party results.  Talking over the hot
coffee - mine mostly cream - proved to be a pleasant affair. Aunt Flora, as Grandma had predicted
was delighted to get so many eggs at once. She surprised us by saying, &ldquo;Now I can make Camp a
birthday cake. His birthday is tomorrow He&rsquo;ll be so pleased that I will be making a cake for him. It
has been some time since I have made anyone a cake,&rdquo; she finished sadly. &ldquo;But - Mama, could I borrow
a cup of sugar? I only have about two cups and it will take three to make the old pound cake that my
family used to love so much.&rdquo; Grandma grinned pleasantly, and said, &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; She was overcome
that Flora would stop rocking long enough to bake a cake - even for her favorite son&rsquo;s birthday. She
said to me, &ldquo;Katie, why don&rsquo;t you run in down to our house and measure up two cups of sugar.&rdquo;
Grandma winked at me, showing her pleasure at Flora&rsquo;s suggestion.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; I promised
and quickly slipped out the door. I returned fairly soon, bearing the required sugar and a few other
items I considered would be necessary suspecting that Aunt Flora did not have a complete cupboard.
I bubbled &ldquo;Grandma, you had two bottles of vanilla flavoring - one full and one just about enough to
bake a cake. I brought the opened one along in case Aunt Flora needed it, too.&rdquo; Now, it was my turn
to wink at Grandma.  &ldquo;Thank you, Katie, because after you left, I realized that I had used the last
of my large bottle.&rdquo; Grandma and I looked at each other silently understanding there would no doubt
be more borrowing of Ingredients before that cake came together.  Grandma was so pleased that her
daughter was doing something for her son, that she would have probably furnished all the
ingredientsjust to get her out of that rocking chair!  &ldquo;Flora, if you find you need anything else
for your cake, just send Fotch down. As you know, I try to keep my cupboard fairly well stocked.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
know you do, Mama. Maybe someday some of your efficiency will rub off on me! I just do not seem to
accomplish much these days. Most of the time, I just find myself rocking and worrying,&rdquo; Flora said
softly.  Grandma felt a little sorry about her remarks she had uttered so lightly - almost with a
tinge of sarcasm. On an impulse, Grandma went over and gave her daughter a quick hug. Flora could
not hide the tear that rolled down her cheek.  I said brightly, &ldquo;I hope there will be a piece ofcake
left for us? I love birthday cakes.&rdquo; Aunt Flora said unsteadily (with emotion), &ldquo;You can count on
it. You will get the piece with the most icing!&rdquo; Grandma and I quickly said our good-byes. Grandma
added gently, &ldquo;You knoq I never saw Flora so sincerely emotional - at least not in years.&rdquo; &ldquo;lt was
almost as if she were promising us that she would get out of that rocking chair more often,&rdquo; I said
thoughtfully.  &ldquo;It was taking her those eggs the day before Camp&rsquo;s birthday. She just had to use
them to bake him a cake. Did you notice that once she got out of that chair, she made a special
effort to play her role as a hostess?&rdquo; Grandma asked.  &ldquo;She di{ didn&rsquo;t she? Do you suppose maybe now
she will try a little harder to keep a better house? It really was pretfy bad, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I was
concerned.  Grandma was suddenly very serious. &ldquo;I can only hope so. Lazy habits are hard to break.
If Camp would straighten up and amount to something, her worries would be lighter. Deep down, Flora
is a fine person. Maybe someday, she can get her act back together.&rdquo; Grandma said sincerely.  &ldquo;I
hope so. Today, I really liked being around her. She really is a kinda sweet person.&rdquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;You got a
rare impression of her today, brrt Irm going to eirnestly hope that she will become a productive
persot again,: Grandma added quietly, &ldquo;Eggq sugar and vanilla flavoring spurred her on to want to
make that birthday cake!&rdquo; I said thoughttully.  &ldquo;And whcn she does, it will be delicious! She used
to be a fine cook,&rdquo; finished Grandma.</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="wes-was-like-this">Wes Was Like This</h1>

<p>One morning after my chores, I was a little bored. I asked Grandma if I could look at her
family photograph album.  &ldquo;Of course. It is on the table in the oarlor.&rdquo; I knew that as I
had seen the weathered book as I dusted in there yesterdav. Quickly I located the book and
started looking with interest at the many photos of Grandma and Grandpa&rsquo;s nine children.
Mostly, I was searching for pictures of my own mother, Ethel, when she was a child. I had
been told thàt I looked a lor like her, but when I found several of her at various ages, I
really could not finc much resemblance. I decided I did not look like her then.  After a
time, I took the old book carefully into the kitchen where Grandma was stringing green
beans. &ldquo;Grandma, I ran across a picture of your don, wes. I really do not know much about
him. could you tell me about him and his kids?- Grandma smiled fondly,and said..I,m glad
you asked. Wes is the quiet strgng qp: I have always been able to depend on him. He has
three ùns, Aubrey, Clyde and Byron.&rdquo; &lsquo;Aubrey has always been the serious one. I wourdn&rsquo;t
be sumrised if somedav he.chose to be a cop of some sort. In cops and Robbers gamès, he
insisted on being the cop and he always got his man.,&rsquo; . &ldquo;clyde and Byron followed in
their father&rsquo;s footsteps - friendly but rather quiet.&rdquo; &ldquo;with nine children, I really don&rsquo;t
see how you can remember important facts about them and their children - my cousins.&rdquo;
&ldquo;well&rsquo; they were born one at a time; and with such a large family and forty grandchildren,
it has sometimes been a challenge, but Ijust try to love them ail and enjoy them when they
visit!&rdquo; I looked up from another picture I was studying. &ldquo;Grandma, I know uncle willard
was in the war, and I have heard the stories àbout him, but I do not know his three
children either. Mama said that the boy&rsquo;s name is Lamar and the girl&rsquo;s (youngest, I think)
name is Eloise, but I do not know the name of his third chlild.&rdquo; &ldquo;l5t when I thought I had
all my grandchildren,s&rsquo;names firmly in my head, ll.ul <em>gTl&rsquo;r</em> name just escapes me. Now go
along with you into tÉe pu.io, urrd finish looking at those pictures, and I&rsquo;ll rack my
brain to iome up with her name. she is apretty little thing and her name is on the tip of
my tongue, but I,ll just have to think about it.&rdquo; &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; I said with a grin. I never knew
my Grandma could forget anything.  Knowing I was pressing my luck, I sai4 &ldquo;Before I go,
Grandma&rsquo; whi!9 ygl are thinkinfabout fhat, could you tell me a little about Aunt FloraS
son Jim? I have never-heard too much about him. Fotch is the expert slingshot guy, but
what did Jim ever do?&rdquo; ..You are a persistent little thing, aren&rsquo;t you? Not many of yorr
grandchildren knew either Jim or shirley. shirley married young and Jim left home early to
seek his fortunes. They were both good kids, and I enjoyed them. I could always depend on
them to run an errand orjust to talk and tell me of their activities. In hei yognger years,
Flora was a conscientious mother and she raised her children right. Most of them listened.
I wasn&rsquo;t sure of what Grandma meant by her last remark, but I excused myself and returned
to the parlor. I found myself eager to look at the rest of the pictures, possibly more
than once.</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="danger-lurks">Danger Lurks</h1>

<p>Grandma was upstairs resting; and I was starting to read the new book Grandpa had brought
to me just ye-st_elday It really was à good book, and I was looking fgrward to reading it;
but I felt restless. I looked out the window at the beautifui, cloudless sky, and I closed
my book firmly. It was entirely too nice outside to be reading inside!  _ In the back of
my head was the usual Grandma precautions about exploring their large farm alone. Just
last week, however, Grandpa had allowed -. to go with him into the barn. what could happen
to me there? The barn was reasonabfe close to the house. Grandma could even look out her
window upstairs if she wanted to.  I threw caution to the wind and decided to explore the
giant old barn.  _ After I adjusted my eyes from the bright sunlight ouiside to the
relatively gloomy interior of the barn, I immediately became-aware of Mabel, their main
source of milk. she gave me one sidelong glance while she continued to chew on her cud&rsquo;
Suddenly, she gave out a very loud &ldquo;moo&rdquo; which resounded in the upper emptiness of the
great barn.  Almost at the same moment, the mare, Nellie Belle, joined Mabel in a pretty
noisy neigh, both of which got through to me that I was not welcome to eoin the barn
alone! Just as I had decided quickly that I would see the barn anothËr time - with
Grandpa, I looked up at the door to find a menacing teenage boy blocking the door to
prevent my leaving.  My heart leapt up into my throat! There stood the BULLY of the area
who lived down near the covered bridge. Both ofmy grandparents had sternly warned me never
to even go near him! His reputation was known far and wide as both a troublemaker and a
real threat to innocent young girls.  &ldquo;Get out of my way, Jeb!&rdquo; I screamed.  Instead of
moving away, he grabbed my ann in a vice_like grip with his strong, dirty hand. I was
about to cry our for help when he clampeâ his other filthy hand over my mouth!  , I was at
the point of passing out from sheer fright when I saw Grandma&rsquo;s bonnet appear around the
corner of the barn!  &ldquo;Jeb Rainey, take your grimy hands off my granddaughter! you have been
warned to.stay offour property. This time you have gone too far! I am going to have
SheriffWarner hunt you down. Release her immediately!&rdquo; .._ Jeb.reluctantly took his hand
offmy mouth, and released my arm. He snarled&rdquo; &ldquo;I was just trying to have a little fun.&rdquo; I
flew to Grandma and she put a protective arm around me. we both stood motionless until Jeb
had reached the road. &ldquo;There now, Sugar Babe. Don&rsquo;t be frightened.&rdquo; (She had never used
Grandpa&rsquo;s endearing name to me before.) we&rsquo;ll gJott ,rp to tire house and have a few
pieces of that chocolate fudge I made this iro-ing. It is for my Garden Club meeting
tomorrow, but I made a little extra.&rdquo; TalÈing loud en-ough for Jeb to hear from the roa4
Grandma warned him sternly, &ldquo;Now, Jeb, I never want to see your evil face around here
again! Now go.&rdquo; érandma was only four foot eleven in height, but her voice a she yelled at
Ieb was six foot five; and he couldn&rsquo;t get out of there fast enough&rsquo; Grandma had such fire
in her eyes that Jeb headed toward his miserable shack down by the bridge without even
tuming back. I saw his face as he left. It was dark and menacing.  I clung to Grandma&rsquo;s
hand as we walked quickly toward the house, also without turning around.</p>
<mbp:pagebreak/><h1 id="horseshoes-in-earnest">Horseshoes In Earnest</h1>

<p>The twins heard from Austin that Grandpa had taught me to play
horseshoes - his style! They challenged me to a game that afternoon.
They had walked over for that express purpose.
I had been practicing for two days in my spare time, and I considered
myself by now to be pretty good. I felt that I was a fine match for my
cousins. We went out into the yard and I was to play Cary first. Mary
encouraged him to play first because she wanted to observe my new style.
Sure enough, as Grandpa had predicted&rdquo; I beat Cary easily. Mary walked
up and said, &ldquo;Now that I know how you throw, it won&rsquo;t be so easy to beat
me!&rdquo;
It was just as easy to beat Mary and she stalked offto the well,
insisting she was very thirsty.
Cary sort of grinned to himself as he realized he was not the only one I
could beat at horseshoes.
Cary and Mary had been playing horseshoes for two or three years, so
they had naturally thought I&rsquo;d be a pushover for them to win.
Mary wanted a rematch. Just as my tum came, I noticed Grandpa standing
by the corner of the house. I couldn&rsquo;t miss the twinkle in his eyes as
if he were spurring his newest pupil on. Grandpa loved to pitch
horseshoes, and he was one of the best in the county.
I still had my horseshoe poised in the air when Cary became aware of
Grandpa&rsquo;s presence. They could never excel at an)&rsquo;thing when adults were
watching. After I expertly got a ringer, Cary missed the mark when his
tum came on the first throw.
&ldquo;way to go, Sugar Babe!&rdquo; Grandpa praised me.
My proud grin would have lit up an electric light bulb!
From the looks on my twin cousins&rsquo;faces, no way were they going to let
me
show them up in front ofGrandpa!
Cary got a leaner on his second throw.
Before my turn, I looked up at Grandma&rsquo;s resting room, and there she was
grinning from ear to ear! Could it be that she s betting on me to win?
I&rsquo;d heard the twins were pretty cocky about their horseshoe prowess, but
now I had the advantage of being able to show offin front of adults.
I aimed with care, and I had another ringer fall in place. It knocked
Cary&rsquo;s leaner flat and to the side.
Panic was beginning to show on the twins&rsquo;faces as they realized how cool
I was with adults around. Also, they had to grudgingly admit that I was
getting
pretty accurate.
&ldquo;somehow that&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; Mary whined.
&ldquo;Fair as rain,&rdquo; Grandpa said&rdquo; coming to look more closely at such a
feat. &ldquo;Sugar Babe, you seem to have a natural talent for this game&rsquo;&rdquo;
Grandpa
couldn&rsquo;t conceal his pleasure. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too cocky, though. Remember
how Mary and Cary beat you in Monopoly last year.&rdquo; He winked at me.
Cary and Mary relaxed visibly and smiled at Grandpa for remembering they
had soundly defeated me at Monopoly - one of the games at which they
excelled. After all, Grandpa didn&rsquo;t have forty &ldquo;Sugar Babes&rdquo; for
nothing! He could be
very diplomatic when he wanted to be. He truly did love us all, and was
always bragging about what fine young citizens we would all be when we
grew up. About this time, Grandma signaled Grandpa from the second story
vantage point! She had spotted the evil Jeb walking boldly across the
dirt road toward us children as we played horseshoes, He was just now
getting the nerve to approach us. Obviously, he had not seen Grandpa!
Grandpa quietly slipped up behind Jeb and grabbed his arm firmly from
behind. &ldquo;Jeb, you were in no uncertain terms to stay offour property!
Now I find you near my grandchildren. You get yourself back to that
miserable shack of yours and never set foot even near our property
again! Now go!&rdquo; Grandpa was furious.
Jeb looked sullenly at Grandpa, but he had more sense that to talk back
to him. He started reluctantly down the road toward the covered bridge.
All of us watched as Jeb walked down the road. Suddenly, we saw a police
patrol car come over the hill. They stopped and forced Jeb inside. Then
they headed back toward Commerce. Grandpa explained to us, &ldquo;The police
have been looking for Jeb for a long time; and now they are finally
taking him to jail. Stalking young girls has not been his only crime,
and he will be lucky if they do not lock him up indefinitely.&rdquo;
I said&rdquo; &ldquo;Even though I know what a terrible person Jeb is, I really hate
to see anyone go to jail.&rdquo;
Grandma assured me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about Jeb. His crimes are so many, he
needs to pay his debt to society - our society!&rdquo;
I remembered and said reluctantly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;
Our horseshoe game had been interrupted by the Jeb incident. Somehow, we
decided we&rsquo;d continue our contest at another time.
Cary tried to say brightly, &ldquo;The Scuppemongs are ripe now Let&rsquo;s go and
eat a few&rdquo;
Mary and I followed him to the vines that were on a large square trellis
with the vines growing overhead, but not too high to reach, even for us
kids. It was one of the joys of summer to eat the sweet grapes.
&ldquo;I had forgotten how good these taste!&rdquo; I said&rdquo; pulling offa handful&rsquo;
&ldquo;You and Mary are lucky to be able to eat these wonderful grapes
an)&rsquo;tlme you want to during the season. Sometimes, I think about how
sweet they are, and I wish I could have them more often.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I never thought we were lucky, but I guess we really are. I like the
Muscadines, too, but they are not as sweet as these Scuppernongs. They
are so different,&rdquo; said Mary.
Cary said, &ldquo;Mary remember Mama said for us to be home by five, so I
guess we&rsquo;d better go.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Today has been fun,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad Jeb had to ruin our
horseshoe game. Maybe you could come back tomorrow. Do you think Aunt
Marie will let you?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Considering that the Jeb incident spoiled our playing today, maybe she
will,&rdquo; Cary said thoughttully.
&ldquo;If we can, we&rsquo;ll be over after lunch,&rdquo; Mary added.
&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; I said and bid them goodbye for now.
Suddenly Mary turned around. She had remembered that they had invited me
over to play Monopoly tomorrow &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to postpone the rematch of
horseshoes because we have already challenged you to play Monopoly.
Remember?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I do now I&rsquo;ll be over therejust after lunch. See ya.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the board all set up,&rdquo; Cary added.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to it,&rdquo; I said. I hoped they would not detect
the smug
look on my face. What they do not know is that for the last three nights
aftei supper, Grandpa has been giving me some very fine pointers about
Monopoly.
I watched as Cary and Mary skipped happily along the narrow road to
their house. They had no thought or fear of meeting a snake along the
way. I guessed it was because they lived on the farm, and could not
constantly be in fear of snakes.
Later that afternoon, Grandma decided to teach me how to milk the cow. I
had already had several unsuccessful tries at milking old Mabel, so I
did not expect much. Grandma patiently showed me one more time; and I
determined I&rsquo;d learn. I squealed with delight when suddenly I succeeded
in getting a spray of milk into the pail!
&ldquo;Remember, you must never come in the barn alone. you know it isn&rsquo;t
safe,,&rsquo; Grandma warned after we&rsquo;d finished with the milkins.
I didn&rsquo;t argue with Grandma as the terrifiing eiperience with Jeb was
still fresh in my mind.
Grandma saw the look in my face. She cheerily said, ,.When you churn the
butter tomorrow, you will be using the milk you just milked yourself.
How about that?&rdquo;
I brightened just a little. &ldquo;Will it really be this milk?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You bet it will. You don&rsquo;t have much there, so I will just add that to
the clabber I already have, stir it up, and it will be fine.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Grandma, will they really put Jeb in jail? He has done some bad things,
but - jail. That us so terrible.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sweetie, when a person cannot live the way other people live, and when
they enjoy hurting other people, they should be put away somewhere so
they can learn a better way of living.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, and he did scare me a lot. Grandma, do - do you
suppose at your Bible Study this week, you could mention the situation
about Jeb?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I was planning to, Dear. This is a situation that has been on our minds
for some time.&rdquo;</p>
